# competitive-programming

This repo has a bunch of personal code snippets related to competitive programming.

C++ code is typically compiled with

```bash
g++ a.cpp -o a.out && ./a.out
```

and `.cpp` files are initialised with

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    //code here
}
```
